# Closed-Form Expression

#math

> In #[[Mathematics]], a _**closed-form expression**_ is a mathematical expression
> that uses a finite number of standard operations. It may contain constants,
> variables, certain well-known operations (e.g., + − × ÷), and functions
> (e.g., nth root, exponent, logarithm, trigonometric functions, and inverse
> hyperbolic functions), but usually no limit, differentiation, or integration[^wiki].

Basically, any mathematical expression distilled down enough that most mere
mortals can understand and calculate the answer.

The main example given is the quadratic equation,

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

Since its solutions can be expressed in terms of elementary functions,

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Analytic Expression

Related is the **analytic expression**: well-known operations that lend
themselves readily to calculation. However, this class of expression tends to
be wider, including special functions (e.g., log, gamma function, Bessel
functions, etc.) which are widely used for certain applications.
