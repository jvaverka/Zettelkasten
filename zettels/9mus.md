# Ruby on Rails

#tech

This popular framework has influence on `Genie.jl`'s creator.
It is a _batteries included_ framework for high developer productivity.

Since it is a mature project with features like `mailers` built-in,
it is currently my best bet to build a quality app fast.
Learning Rails will also open my eyes to what is missing in the Genie Framework.
Using Rails will improve my understanding for where `Genie.jl` aims to go.
With a better knowledge of both, maybe I can write plugins for `Genie.jl` which
will bring it closer to feature parity and give me more opportunity to build
things inside and outside of company work.
