We puny humans use **functions** to represent physical quantities or phenomena,
**derivatives** to represent rates of change of these phenomena, and the
**differential equation** defines a relationship between the two.

Since only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas,
we mostly only study solutions (sets of functions that satisfy each equation)
and properties of solutions.

When [[a786|Closed-Form Expression]] are not available solutions may be
approximated numerically.
