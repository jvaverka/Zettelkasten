# Conventional Commits

Specification for Git commit messages used by default in
[commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/).
It aims to ensure creation of commit messages readable by both humans & machines.
In so doing, changes to a code base are obvious for users _and_ actionable for
build pipelines and release cycles.

Quick summaries and the full specification can be found on the organization
website[^cc].
