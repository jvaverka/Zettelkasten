# :house_with_garden: Home

Welcome to the home page of my zettlekasten!
Each note is a stepping-stone in my pursuit of knowledge in various topics.
The zettlekasten as a whole represents my journey on this pursuit.
Exploring this tree structure hopefully leads to new discoveries and insights.

## Tools

Creating this knowledge base is possible thanks to 3 great tools:

1. [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/) - spiritual successor to [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/)
