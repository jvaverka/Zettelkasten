# Root

Welcome to my zettlekasten and the uʍop-ǝpᴉsdn root of this tree.
Each node is a note I have accrued in my pursuit of knowledge in various topics.
Each branch represents a collection of related notes.
Exploring this tree structure hopefully leads to new discoveries and insights.

## Tools

Creating this knowledge base is possible thanks to 3 great tools:

1. [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/) - spiritual successor to [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/)
1. [zk](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk) - plain text note-taking assistant
1. [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - hyperextensible Vim-based text editor
