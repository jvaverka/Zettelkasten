Building a website for A-Rud's new business.
In exchange for some contracting work done for me.
So, not making me money in the short-term, but hopefully will in the long-term.
I.e., this is an investment into [[qota|Side Business]].

Start with example site of company offering similar services[^nccl].
Make sure there are links to book an appointment / get a quote _everywhere_.

## Goals

- Payback A-Rud
- Learn [[9mus|Ruby on Rails]]# framework
- Get referrals from A-Rud
