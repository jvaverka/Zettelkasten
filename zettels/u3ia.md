# Spaceship You

Outside is under a dangerous attack.
To self & loved ones, you must board **Spaceship You** and orbit Earth.
However, this is not a break or holiday.
Earth will need us in the near future.

**Mission: Return better than you left[^yt].**

To accomplish this, you must maintain the vessel.
This means keeping the generator online and operational.
There are 2 main cores which comprise the generator:

1. Physical
1. Mental

Each half powers the other and therefore they share equal importance.
To keep both cores fully operational we need 4 dedicated spaces on the ship.

Maintain the spaces, and the spaces will maintain you.

!!! note
    Maintain the generator => accomplish the mission.
    As you are the only crew, this is your responsibility alone.

## Physical Exercise Station

Unsurprisingly, this station is vital to keeping the **Physical** core primed.
This dedicated space is **non-optional**.
This space will prime your body and mind for challenging physical activity.

!!! note
    No equipment necessary.
    Consider using bio-sphere where permitted.
    Mimimum time-limits must always be observed.

## Sleeping Station

This dedicated space is for **sleeping _only_**.
Aides and routines should be integrated into this quarter to maximize rest.
Use alarm clocks to set your structure.

!!! note
    If you find that you are here for > 30 minutes and awake,
    then leave and try again later because again _this is for sleeping only_.

## Recreation Station

Location for leisure activities where you are actively engaged.
Your full attention is focused on the activity that leaves you feeling better
after: e.g., reading nook, movie theater, game room, virtual cafe.

!!! note
    This is a refreshing, fun space.
    Maximum time-limits should be observed.
    Quality of time should be continuously monitored

### Couch Quarters

Distinctly separate space in **Recreation** Station.
Important for its use in rejuvenating down-time.
Leads to lethargy, self-radiation, agitation, and anxiety when left unchecked.

!!! note
    Comes pre-installed on all vessels.
    Almost always fairly comfy.

## Creation Station

Purpose: achieve a positive feedback loop in which:

- You positively affect your environment
- Your environment positively affects you

### Scope of Creation

Ultimately, the scope of **Creation** is everything you have the power to affect.
_You_ are included in this scope.
Crafts, code, and cooking are also forms of creation.

Through work you can create things of value (to yourself & others).
Through study and research you can cultivate knowledge.
Through practice you can attain skills.

This station is vital to keeping the **Mental** core primed.

!!! note
    Recognize that you have already **created** the other stations;
    thereby shaping your ideal environment to help accomplish the mission.
    Keeping this space clean, preped, and dedicated to creation alone is vital.
